This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds. The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides the corrected version. The error arises from an attempt to access an element beyond the array's upper bound within a loop.  Ada's strong typing system usually prevents this kind of error at compile time but the example shows a runtime error that is difficult to spot. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle array bounds to avoid runtime exceptions.
